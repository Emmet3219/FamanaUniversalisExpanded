  abolish_sifa_title:0 "Abolish Sifa"
  abolish_sifa_desc:0 "A fundamental part of the Oppian religion is Sifa, a kind of spiritual energy everyone is born with and can never change.

As a bastion of the Reformed Oppian faith, we ought to end this regressive institution if we are able to do so."

  relight_pawani_pyramids_decision_desc:0 "The city of Pexamol was the ancient centre of the Pawani faith. Now that we have taken it back, we turn towards the ancient temples and pyramids that litter the city, long thrown into disarray by years of Xalian rule. In the past, they were used for many religious services, such as creating massive bonfires on their tips to ward off evil spirits, and to catalogue the movements of the heavens. We can finally restore these old functions."

  restore_xalian_military_title:0 "£mil£ Restore the Xalian Religion by Force"
  restore_xalian_military_desc:0 "The Xalian People have long been divided by a pointless schism. There is too much infighting over this God and that God, and we've completely lost track of who we are. We have also disgraced our religion with our own personal interests, promoting the Gods we want instead of seeing the Universe as it is. It is time we finally settle this pointless matter, and return to a state of brotherhood, celebrating all four Gods equally."

 tck_search_blade_of_astom_title:0 "Search for the Blade of Astom"
 tck_search_blade_of_astom_desc:0 "The Blade of Astom was a crucial artefact of the Oppian Empire. It was wielded by the Oppian Emperor itself. It got its name from the Astom people, from which the City would be derived, where it was said to have been given to the Emperor as a gift. Although there are many legends about its supposedly magical powers, it is still just a sword; albeit, one that could give us immense military inspiration should we proclaim ourselves its owner."

 tck_search_galagums_urn_title:0 "Search for Galagum's Urn"
 tck_search_galagums_urn_desc:0 "Galagum Accatis was one of the most famous diplomats and generals of the Oppian Empire. Although he came from our rival family - the Accatis - we still cannot deny his excellance. It was he who famously led campaigns against many of the natives of the Oppian Empire, but that was not his most famous feat. No, he is nowadays best known for his invasion of Maky as well as his negotiations that eventually led to the King of Maky swearing himself an Oppian Subject. When he died, he was cremated and his ashes were put in an Urn in Quanex - which just so happened to disappear in the messy collapse of Oppia. Hunting his ashes down will allow us to both assert our final dominance over the last living Accatis nowadays, and compare him to our own diplomatic genius, Mensel Sar."

 tck_search_imperial_standard_title:0 "Search for the First Imperial Standard"
 tck_search_imperial_standard_desc:0 "The First Imperial Standard was created when the warring Oppian City States officially united under the then Oppian Confederation, ruled by the Oppian Emperor. Over time, as Oppia Expanded, the confederation lost their power and the Emperor gained more control over the Empire, but throughout Oppia's entire history, one iconic flag was flown. The first design of this flag was on show at the Imperial Palace of Quanex, but must've been stolen following the collapse of the Oppian Empire. This is unnacceptable. If we manage to find it again, we will be able to compare our modern state to the same expansionist history as the Oppian Empire."
