 oppia.2.t:0 "The Discovery of Kotzbal"
 oppia.2.d:0 "Umzatian explorers have discovered the distant island of Kotzbal. They say it is uninhabited and open for Umzatian settlement. Perhaps it is time to expand our influence outside of the mainland. After all, we have always been a navigatory people."
 oppia.2.a:0 "This is a worthwhile endeavor!"
 oppia.2.b:0 "We have more important things at hand."

 oppia.15.t:0 "The Western Frontier"
 oppia.15.d:0 "Explorers come with good news! The lightly settled lands west of the border are rich in resources and open for Oppian pioneers to colonize. Exotic commodities, such as dyes and spice, exist in abundance. They call these lands 'Asetli', the land of bounty. We would be fools not to sponsor a campaign to settle there permanently, they say. It would be a risky venture, but if the rumors are true, it could be a great asset to our growing nation."
 oppia.15.a:0 "These lands will be ours!"
 oppia.15.b:0 "This sounds dangerous."
 oppia.16.t:0 "A Strategic City"
 oppia.16.d:0 "The colonization of Asetli has been an astounding success. New cities have been constructed by our brave pioneers, creating new economic activity and trade routes in the region. Artisans, farmers and merchants alike now call Asetli home. But perhaps, Asetli could use a new addition. Some explorers have pointed out the strategic importance of the Cape of Vinkim, and call for a new city to be built there. If we were to seize control of it, we would have complete control of all trade coming in and out of the Gomic Sea. Such a move might upset other powers, but it would also grant us even more leverage in trade than we do even now."
 oppia.16.a:0 "It will serve us well."

Therefore, our advisor tells us, it would be wise to sell our possessions on Ameleka to Xofka, in exchange for 100 ducats. Perhaps, he is right."

Diplomats from Agixiana continually pester us about it, and it would not be a surprise to see the armies of Agixion seize the provinces at any moment. Therefore, it might be best to simply sell the land to the Agixianans in exchange for 300 ducats."

Strategically placed between Emastalia and Stroktur, it could be used to project power in many directions. He orders the expulsion of the local Emastalian population and the conversion of Tyarda into the grand capital of Nafa. It shall be rechristened as 'Syadona', and serve as a base of operations for Syadon's further conquests."

Ever since they landed in the north, the Nafans have been an overbearing presence in the Xalian peninsula. Now, it seems, they are no longer hiding their ultimate intentions, the complete conquest of Ga Xal. It would be foolish to resist the might of Nafa, but if we do not, our statehood will be liquidated. $MONARCHTITLE$ [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands before an impossible choice.

 pextoglazia.5.d:0 "Pextoglazia was founded as a union between two peoples - the Glazians and the Pextans. Just like the balance between church and state, this was a fragile balance that was never well kept. Ethnic violence has recently tipped the scales, as ethnic nationalists have risen up on both sides to dismantle our state."
 pextoglazia.5.a:0 "The nail in the coffin."

 pextoglazia.6.t:0 "War Weariness"
 pextoglazia.6.d:0 "The ongoing civil war has resulted in war weariness among our population. People are deserting the army and our state is becoming less legitimate."

 pextoglazia.16.t:0 "Returning to Our Roots"
 pextoglazia.16.d:0 "We find ourselves in Pextum, our old homeland. Decades ago, we fled from the overbearing New Xalian Empire to keep our freedom. We made a new home for ourselves, we faced immense struggle, and we created the Lathvy faith. But a new option is now presenting itself, namely the idea of returning to our traditional beliefs. Some call it heretical, others appropriate."
 pextoglazia.16.a:0 "Pawani it is."
 pextoglazia.16.b:0 "Heretics, all of them!"
 pextoglazia.17.t:0 "The Diocese of Moxon"
 pextoglazia.17.d:0 "We have brought the people of Moxon, who were once our closest brothers in faith, under Pextoglazian rule. Now, we are at a crossroads, as many local religious thinkers wish to establish a Maxan Diocese following the Pextoglazian School. Direct control of the land would benefit us tremendously, as Moxon is a very wealthy archipelago, yet the prospect of a local bulwark against heathen faiths in the Eastern Gomic is something we must consider."
 pextoglazia.17.a:0 "It will be a bastion of Lathvy!"
 pextoglazia.17.b:0 "Let us bring the local talent to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] instead."

 gaxal.9.t:0 "An Unfitting Name"
 gaxal.9.d:0 "The founders of our country were Lathvyites, and named it after their faith. Now that our state our religion has changed, a new name is needed. Advisiors propose to simply name it after our historic capital, Trilsekin."
 gaxal.9.a:0 "Fine."

 gaxal.10.t:0 "The Pirates of Maner Island"
 gaxal.10.d:0 "The $MONARCHTITLE$ and royal family of Maner have been assassinated! Undoubtedly the work of Maner's despicable pirates, what remains of the government now has a choice to make: either allow the pirates to take over the island, or give control to the more legitimate merchant guilds. Letting the merchants take over would destabilize the situation, but may be the better call."

 gaxal.10.b:0 "The merchants should take over instead."

 lathvy.4.t:0 "A Reliquary"

 lathvy.4.b:0 "We'll do it, but let's keep it modest."
 lathvy.4.c:0 "We need money for other purposes"
 lathvy.5.t:0 "Heir Involved in Heretical Practices"
 lathvy.5.d:0 "One of the courtiers caught your heir performing strange rituals in the castle dungeons. Although he quickly confessed and maintains that he does not worship Loys, it is certain that his actions are not in line with Lathvy's principles."
 lathvy.5.a:0 "Exile the heretic!"
 lathvy.5.b:0 "The clergy will show him to the right path."
 lathvy.5.c:0 "That does not concern me."
 lathvy.6.t:0 "Returning Scholars"
 lathvy.6.d:0 "Particularly in the early days of our faith, Pextoglazia and Moxon emerged as the foremost centers of scholarly learning in the Lathvy world. Scholars of every persuasion flocked to Pomlen and Agixion to learn from the most renowned teachers of science, theology, and above all law. Many students from our lands, having completed their educational pilgrimage, are now returning home and hoping to implement their knowledge in our [Root.GovernmentName] just as they learned it in the heartlands of Lathvy."
 lathvy.6.a:0 "They will make a welcome addition to our country."
 lathvy.6.b:0 "I can do things my own way."
 lathvy.7.t:0 "Lathvy Factions Rally Support"
 lathvy.7.d:0 "Early Lathvy, because of its simplicity, was divided into many factions interpreting Romal Anohar's teachings differently. Seeing the weakened state of our armies, the leader of a major order has begun urging his followers to take up arms in support of us against our enemies."
 lathvy.7.a:0 "Seeking help from the misguided will only make our situation worse."
 lathvy.7.b:0 "Let us welcome these warriors of faith."
 lathvy.8.t:0 "Violence"
 lathvy.8.d:0 "A group of charismatic preachers in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have begun inciting the populace against other Lathvy schools, leading to violence and street battles."
 lathvy.8.a:0 "Stamp down on the movement."
 lathvy.8.b:0 "Offer them our support."
 lathvy.9.t:0 "Debate Over Practices of Certain Schools"
 lathvy.9.d:0 "Lathvy scholars were not united on the question of our faith's unity. While some appreciated the heightened levels of religious devotion inspired among the general population by affiliation with smaller factions, some disapproved of how certain ones expressed their faith. Poetry and song about wine and illicit love, as well as communal dancing and veneration for the tombs of those regarded as saints, could at times provoke opposition from more hardline elements of the clergy."
 lathvy.9.a:0 "Advocate for unity."
 lathvy.9.b:0 "Fuel the divide."
 lathvy.10.t:0 "Purification of Tax Laws"
 lathvy.10.d:0 "Ensuring that the realm's laws operate in accordance with the sacred texts requires us to occasionally re-examine our tax collection practices, and to strive to align them as closely as possible with the legal positions held by the great lawmakers of our [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school. This means eliminating the customary taxes which have accumulated over the years, and taking only what is permitted by Ara."
 lathvy.10.a:0 "If Ara wills it."
 lathvy.10.b:0 "Tax breaks? In my country?"
 lathvy.11.t:0 "Traditional Beliefs"
 lathvy.11.d:0 "In some rural areas like the forests of Ordica or the hills of Kapolia Lathvy has adopted a lot of local pagan beliefs. A prominent cleric has taken a strong stance against those practices, worrying that these people don't worship the real Ara."
 lathvy.11.b:0 "There are many ways to God."
 lathvy.11.a:0 "We must ban these practices from the realm."
 lathvy.12.t:0 "Trade Guilds and Fraternities"
 lathvy.12.d:0 "Guilds and fraternities are a constant factor in the public life of the [Root.GovernmentName], in many ways these are small communities within the community, with their own rules, customs and even laws. It is also common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, and often unorthodox adaption of the Romal's teachings. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the clergy to penetrate the urban milieu. An artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs. Anyone wishing to take up a craft in the city is currently required to be approved by this man and then swear an oath of allegiance."
 lathvy.12.a:0 "This is unacceptable."
 lathvy.12.b:0 "Let us not interfere with the guilds."
 lathvy.13.t:0 "Religious orders growing in popularity in [new_province.GetName]"
 lathvy.13.d:0 "Some of the more controversial religious orders in [Root.GetName] have quickly started to establish themselves in the newly acquired [new_province.GetName] province. While the locals seem somewhat hesitant about [Root.GetAdjective] rule they have embraced the orders and this has greatly eased the integration of the province into our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 lathvy.13.a:0 "Strengthen the legal establishment instead."
 lathvy.13.b:0 "This is excellent"
 lathvy.14.t:0 "Disregard of the Lathvy law?"
 lathvy.14.d:0 "The learned clergymen complain over the widespread flouting of Lathvy rules in our [Root.GovernmentName]. They demand that we reduce the influence of Mystic orders and heterodoxy in the country. Failing to comply could see us risking losing their support and many of these valuable legal scholars might even leave for other courts."
 lathvy.14.a:0 "Let us follow their recommendations."
 lathvy.14.b:0 "We cannot give in to such threats."
 lathvy.15.t:0 "Friday Prayers?"
 lathvy.15.d:0 "The weekly congregational prayer has been a way for Lathvy rulers to show their legitimacy for a long time. However, some say that kings should leave these matters to the clergy or that they are simply using religion as a tool of control."
 lathvy.15.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will lead the friday prayers and our country will pray."

It is famous for inventing the Hamburger, and although it would remain for centuries as one restaurant, it would eventually expand by the modern era into a global brand. Whappers would become an icon of Jimkalin, and millions of tourists would pour into the palace-sized institution to enjoy fine dining."

 lathvy.1.d:0 "The bishop of a major temple has presented the idea of installing colored stained glass in the windows and getting rid of a couple of fire bowls, in keeping with the foreign fashion.

 aresian_dec.1.t:0 "Excessive Tithes"
 aresian_dec.1.d:0 "The Aresian church is demanding increasingly outrageous tithes from our peasants. Of course, pleasing Phamsa is paramount, but only to a point. The level of religious taxation is becoming crippling for many peasant farmers, and perhaps now it is time for the state to step in."

 aresian_dec.2.t:0 "Nepotism in Government"
 aresian_dec.2.d:0 "Our statesmen are simply put incompetent. Ours is a system where jobs are inherited and not earned. While this may be politically convenient, it is disastrous for the functioning of our nation. Our advisors have proposed that we institute a system of examination to find our new bureaucrats. However, this reform would also require us to purge our state of people unfit for their jobs."

 vanoma.5.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had an idea. While Vanoma is a very advanced and prosperous nation, it lacks knowledge of the outside world. The Vanomans are aware of the existence of a great civilization straddling the shorelines of a vast inland sea, somewhere far in the south. A nation known as Moxon once contacted them to use their technology in a war against pale, monstruous beasts. Those same beasts then attacked Vanoma some decades later! To avoid such situations in the future, it would be very useful to know what is happening in the south. Therefore, an expedition should be sent to travel, map out and document the various countries of the region. It would be an expensive endeavor, however, and Vanoma is not the most outgoing nation."

The cities of Ximal, Sixan, Agixion and especially Xon strike awe into the delegation members. Xon in particular is an incredible feat of architecture. It is not just the cities that impress, however, but also the local technology. Many unique inventions, some of which are completely new to us, prove that Vanoma is not the only inventive society.

The Lathvy religion, which we have known about for a long time thanks to Stroktur and Kapolia, seems to have originated in the Pextoglazian capital city of Pomlen. We have visited the Pextoglazian High Priest, and he taught us many interesting, but heretical, lessons.

It should come as no surprise that our lands have plunged into chaos the likes of which they have not seen since the end of the war with the Moxon.

Above all, however, they are becoming more and more like their colonial brothers from the west, who have already established their own Emastalian culture."

Paper is a material we are incapable of producing ourselves, but could be very useful. Many chiefs call for us to attack Vanoma and seize their colony for this very reason, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is considering another idea. The Vanomans are significantly more technologically advanced than us, which raises the question of whether or not we should really be messing with them. Perhaps a better approach would be to make them an offer and spare their colony in exchange for some of their technology.

But, if we choose to help them, they will let our colony be and establish an alliance with us.

Control of it would constitute a great source of revenue for the Tonxara, so it would be a no-brainer to extend our borders into the desert if it provided us with increased control of the Milk Road.

After many months of travel, we saw water, although vegetation was still lacking. Our expedition decided to go north, along the coast that did not curve in any direction. We encountered a caravan of the 'Totokarans', with whom we communicated after discovering a few similar words.

The merchants took us on board their ship and soon afterwards we left. The journey across this water, called the 'Ovol Sea', took much longer than we expected, but the waves were calm. We landed in a country as dry as the one we had left, but very mountainous, which reminded us of the beginning of the trip. As we got deeper into the mountains the weather became more pleasant and more plants appeared. We saw a plateau and a city on top of it. At the market, we bought many valuable spices, but our presence caught the attention of the ruler of this city and we were led to a his castle. We told our story, which pleased him. We learned that he was only the administrator of a poor province and if we wanted to see the true greatness of Geopyopia we had to go to Mount Washoom. At this point he started telling us about the Geopyopian religion which seems to be centered around this 'sacred' peak. We did not listen to these heresies which angered the ruler and we were thrown out of the town. Some decided to go south and visit Mount Washoom, but most of us started our journey back and boarded the nearest ship to the Totokaran desert."

 bosisi.11.d:0 "We paddled up the Makyna until the land became a green, fertile steppe. The river became too shallow and narrow to sail any further, so we disembarked and moved by foot, replenishing our supplies with the surrounding vegetation. On the horizon, huge mountains appeared, snow-capped despite the scorching heat. At their foot, we met a group of shepherds who kindly led us to their settlement. Some of them were going to a big town, so we followed them through the mountains for days, until we saw a shallow valley with a city. At that moment and the power and wealth of Dorromas became obvious. We split up crossing the gate to this place, equal perhaps only to Xon or Quanex. Despite the language difficulties, we were welcomed into the richly decorated palace of some very important person. We learned that they follow a religion completely different from ours and that Dorromas is only a remnant of the 'Agmagozi Empire', which, if their descriptions are true, could have put anything in the Gomic to shame."

They pushed towards our homeland, but we fled into such unfavourable terrain that even they did not want to chase us. Had it not been for the Great Sanctuary Lake, all Antiash would have starved to death and that would have been the end. Now we are standing in their capital and the terrified population is running under our feet. What to do?"

With closer inspection, some of them appeared to exhibit an oblong shape. During the course of the night, some of these dots seemed to shatter into many pieces. Then, one began glowing red and growing in size as it straked across our sky.\n\nThis morning, inhabitants of a village have proclaimed that the object seen flying through the sky yesterday landed in one of their fields. It had caused a loud bang and burnt many of their crops. The object is nothing like we've seen before, long and slender, made of some transcendant materials but charred black, and full of metal ropes. Inside the object, there are rooms and hallways, filled with dead Yomtanians. The people of our nation believe that we have discovered a comet that has fallen to the Earth, meaning extremely bad luck unless we disassemble it to rid the evil presence."

Government officials have worked with parts of the Nahallaian army to undermine the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and replace him with a new leader. Today, the coup began. An attempt on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s life has left him scarred and deformed. The very existence of the Nahallaian state is now under threat, as the coup leaves the country vulnerable to attacks from tribes, the Tolans or even Ordica itself."

 nahallaia.2.d:0 "Nahallaia is in chaos. As two rival [NHLMonarch.GetTitle]s fight for control of the nation, they give us an opportunity to restore the great nation of Tolo. If we enter Nahallaia with our troops and support the new pretender to the throne, we can destroy the Nahallaian state forever.

 nahallaia.5.t:0 "Tolo Defeated"
 nahallaia.5.d:0 "Against all odds, we have held our empire together. Alo Tramo has been defeated, as have the pretenders to our throne. Nahallaia remains the supreme ruler of Western Ordica. Now, to ensure this never happens again, we must assimilate the Tolans into our culture."

Although there have been scholarly debates about the source of authority in the religion and on minor topics, no faction has been more separate than the recent Rochoni Lathvyites. Formed out of dissatisfied Naravamis as well as rebellious tribal chiefs in Ordica, this new denomination rejects the ecumenicalism of traditional Lathvy, operating on its own basis. It claims that Ara and Loys are equally beyond human comprehension or understanding, and so the Human world is completely irrelevant to their fight. Rather than a battleground for the Gods, Rochonis claim that the World is merely an illusion, or projection, of their struggle."

After its collapse, the project's fate was left in jeopardy, and it seems whatever new cliques came after the Empire's downfall have refused to further fund the Tower. Despite this, the tower was still eventually completed, mostly due to money paid out by the Vinian and Shirian churches for the establishment of the Temple. Now that it is fully completed, it stands as the tallest man-made structure on the entire planet.s"

Horrified onlookers watched on as the Xalian temple, which was only finished after almost half a century of work emitted, thick columns of smoke and then collapsed on itself. Nobody was hurt in the incident as proper evacuation procedures were used, but this has resulted in the destruction of precious Xalnish religious artefacts as well as the Giru Tower losing its status as the tallest structure in the world."

It was named after the interchange of Ravsho Milking Bovines with Gomic Meat Bovines, introducing the lactose-intolerant Gomic people to drinking milk. Despite its name however, the largest component of this trade was the interchange of artefacts between the Gomic and Geopyopians. While traders in Jasua had long known of the existence of a civilisation beyond the steppe due to rogue artefacts, this more streamlined process of trade not only confirmed it but contributed to a cultural exchange of sorts. The Gomic and Geopyopian cultures swapped plants and animals, and artefacts from the Mountain Empire became treasured across the Gomic."

On the other hand, hunting them is very profitable due to their teeth, bones and meat. It seems that the dragons couldn't keep up with the advancing technology and growing population and the woodsmen wiped them out almost completely with only small groups remaining in the highest mountains. It is hard to find one and even harder to kill it, so it seems the age of dragon hunting is over."

These books were also some of the first to use a Codex format, instead of more traditional Scrolls, possibly due to ease of carry. Being a scribe suddenly became an immensely lucrative job in many Lathvy countries, and the trade of paper, papyrus, vellum and other writing materials blossomed."

 naravam.11.d:0 "A group of severely weakened wanderers entered [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] last night. They were recognised as a small part of the expedition sent past the mountains. The shaman who was their leader told us how after leaving the heights they entered a forest, only slightly warmer and vegetated than the peaks. Eventually then found themselves at a shore of a frozen sea where they met a group of tribal people and received gold in exchange for food and other supplies. This turned out disasterous as the adventurers began running out of food and couldn't forage much in the cold forests. The group decided to come back and many died before returning home. During this terrible journey, they found no trace of the Gods apart from the occasional strange atmosphere at night."

 naravam.12.t:0 "The expedition returns after meeting the Gods"
 naravam.12.d:0 "The adventurers came back carrying good news; while they weren't able to convince any God to come with them, they have met many in far away domains. At the northern edge of the mountain range they were approached by a talking wolf-man who became their guide and they together descended into a mystic forest populated by poweful Gods and teeming with lesser spirits. They spent many days in this place in a some sort of an elevated state talking to chief beings from our mythology, drinking ambrosia and going on hunts. The shamans eventually decided that it would be selfish to stay there and decided to return, of course not before asking for a blessing for our nation."
 naravam.12.a:0 "Those men are heroes."
 naravam.12.b:0 "Pay someone educated to write down their epic journey."
 
 lathvy.21.t:0 "Modified Prayer Books spreading!"
 lathvy.21.d:0 "Lathvy Prayer Books are often standardised to the word, and it is expected that all copies follow this standardisation. However, recently Lathvy authorities have gotten ahold of some heretical translations, likely produced by some rogue scribes. If we let these spread, we will be imposing religious censorship but it will prevent heresy."
 lathvy.21.a:0 "Burn them!"

 lathvy.22.d:0 "Recently, [Root.Heir.GetName] was caught drinking wine at a party with some other wealthy aristocrats. This is unacceptable, as all forms of Alcohol are banned in the Lathvy religion. Despite this, we must consider whether or not it is worth it to punish our own flesh and blood for such a relatively minor transgression, as doing so could hurt our own rule's credibility."

 ordica.27.t:0 "Brain Drain across Ordica!"
 ordica.27.d:0 "Ordica was never a bastion of population. Most of the nation consists of tribal clans who swear loyalty to Nabrosia only under threat of the Crown's army. This has been exemplified by the recent crisis at the top, which causes what few scholars Ordica did have to flee the nation. This has also been the product of increasing popularity of Nafan interpretations of Lathvy over the Celzion school."
 ordica.27.a:0 "Invite Foreign Scholars to replace them."
 ordica.27.b:0 "We cannot trust foreigners. Pay off whoever's left."

 ordica.28.t:0 "Religious debate overwhelms the country!"
 ordica.28.d:0 "Ever since the late 3rd century, religious debate in Lathvy has become more and more radical. What was once one faith has shattered into all manner of interpretations. With the ongoing crisis, we are at risk of being overwhelmed by such a debate."
 ordica.28.a:0 "Encourage religious debate - outside the King's chambers."
 ordica.28.b:0 "What the King believes is right. Burn all heretical books."

 ordica.29.a:0 "Who do they think they are!?"
 
 ordica.30.t:0 "Rochoni believers rise up!"
 ordica.30.d:0 "As the Rochoni faith begins to spread into Ordica, many clans who adopt the religion are getting ready to rise up in arms against the Crown in the name of their religious interests. This threatens the Ordican King's position."
 ordica.30.a:0 "Deal with them - using force."
 ordica.30.b:0 "Maybe they have a point."

 ordica.31.t:0 "People lose trust in the Crown"
 ordica.31.d:0 "After a series of bad choices and hurting the people of Ordica, the legitimacy of Ordican rule is starting to be questioned. If we ignore this fact and continue to pressure out people, we may as well see the fall of our nation."

 ordica.31.b:0 "Who cares, exactly?"

 ordica.32.t:0 "Rise of Ordisa"
 ordica.32.d:0 "The nation of Ordisa arose out of Ordica following a series of reforms done by the state to alleviate the pressures of its 5th century crisis. The new state is much more scholarly, tolerant and has much better built up institutions, in many ways inspired by Syadon's Nafan Empire. As the dust settles, the Philosopher Kings of Ordisa can look forwards to a bright future for their nation."
 ordica.32.a:0 "We have survived."

 ordica.34.t:0 "Collapse of Ordica!"
 ordica.34.d:0 "Following a series of poor choices by the Ordican Government, the local Clans and Chiefs have risen up and the Kingdom has been dissolved. In its aftermath, a variety of states have taken its place. It is highly unlikely that a united Ordica can return under these new conditions."
 ordica.34.a:0 "C'est fini."

 soy.1.t:0 "Ajetaz the Great"
 soy.1.d:0 "Ajestaz, a relatively young yet ambitious boy, has recently risen to prominence in our tribe. Originally a 11 year old orphan who was adopted by a shaman of Mayu'Tasi, he grew up all around shamans, their rituals and such. He always had a keen interests in all of these things, but always feared going out to the rituals himself, preferring to stay at his Shaman's hut, reading and rewriting various religious texts. That is, until recently of course. The main Soy religious ritual is drawing what they call "Vra'Mees"; they are religious drawings depicting Mayu'Tasi or the Soy Tribe in either the future or the past, depicting how things could go in both. Aftewards, they all ritually burn them at a fire, and the one thats the most intact after a set amount of time is believed to be the most likely to happen, with its state determining how likely it is. Ajestaz recently claimed that he has been visited by Mayu'Tasi in a dream, and a fiery ambition was spurred in him. He was so stubborn about participating in the next Vra'Mees drawing ritual, that the tribe Shamans let him in. Aftewards, he procceeded to draw an extremely well-detailed map potraying future Soy conquests, though with weird small islands added on most coasts and lakes. He now does this regularly, along with receiving supposed dreams from Mayu'Tasi. He has become extremely popular in the tribe and abroad; resulting in there being a huge movement in making him the new heir to the Soy throne. Denying that will result in what would basically be a coup; his following is too big."

The boy has recently been found talking with many local shamans about religion, philosophy and history; eager to learn about the past, future and present. He has also been forward thinking, talking with more revolutionary thinkers - being interested and wanting to learn from all philosophies alike. Ajestaz has been also found taking an interest in military strategy, conversing with local officers and generals that travel or reside in our nation. His presence interested the, admittedly small, intellectual base of the desert we reside in and even beyond in the far away lands of Hoxoi or Kurkar. He has now requested to start investing greater funds in our writings; perhaps to start some sort of library where books could be stored and conversations could be written down (to which scribes would be needed). Should we start investing in the intellectual base of our country, surely more great minds will arise."

The crowning ceremony is long, and before Ajetaz is actually crowned, the traditional ritual of drawing Vra'Mees in honour of Mayu'Tasi is taking place. Most of them are drawn under the influence of the Soy Powder, as it is believed to help communicate with Mayu'Tasi - in the end, most are depicting the future of Soy, with great future ahead of it with Ajetaz at its head. The ceremonious fire is being started, and, as expected by most, Ajetaz's Vra'Mee lasts the longest -  it depicts a map of the great Soy empire, controling large swathes of land, while also being technologically advanced as depicted on other parts of the Vra'Mee. Many take this as a great sign of fortune to come, and of Ajetaz's great reign that is right to begin, as is the coronation ceremony. Its grand, with the chief shaman of the tribe, under heavy influence of the Soy powder - as are most of the participants - places the ceremonious crown, said to be crafted by Mayu'Tasi himself, on Ajetaz's head. Right then and there, the crowd erupts into cheering, and many Soy Powder parties begin that will not end until tomorrow. This drug-influenced ceremony marks the begining of a new era for the Soy nation, an era of greatness and prosperity!"
