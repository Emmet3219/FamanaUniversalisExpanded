 desc_feudalism:0 "Metallurgy is the art of shaping and reshaping metals to create useful objects, parts and large scale structures. Although iron was discovered centuries ago, advanced metalworking was first pioneered in ancient Ga Xal."
 desc_renaissance:0 "Liturgy represents a communal response to and participation in the sacred through activities reflecting praise, thanksgiving, remembrance, supplication or repentance and forms a basis for establishing a relationship with a divine agency. Liturgy first arose in the ancient Lathvy world."
 desc_new_world_i:0 "Tonmo numerals, invented by Tonmo scholars in the fourth century, was the first widely adopted modern decimal numbering system. The rapid spread of this convenient system benefitted merchants massively, simplifying trade and breaking down the barriers that differing numbering systems caused. These numerals were adopted by most of the Gomic world by the end of the century, and would remain the numerals of choice until the modern era."
 desc_printing_press:0 "The Edolyssa represented a revolution in hygiene that spread rapidly throughout the Gomic world under the Nafan Empire. Influential Kachik figures pushed massive steps towards a more healthy lifestyle for millions of people, building hospitals and spreading knowledge on health and hygiene. The Edolyssa eventually laid the groundwork for modern medicine and significantly improved the quality of life for peasants, as diseases could be more effectively combated."
 desc_global_trade:0 "When the Urbaxan Empire sought to expand north beyond the Great Desert, they needed a method of transport that could reliably cross the scorching sand dunes. Horses wouldn't do, as they quickly died of thirst in the desert. The dalgaz, an animal native to the Qamoni Hinterlands, could however survive for long periods in the desert due to its ability to store water. This animal was domesticated, and soon caravans of Urbaxan traders could cross the desert freely. The age of the caravan had begun, an age where the desert itself could be tamed and Qamoni goods could reach the shores of the Gomic safely."
 desc_manufactories:0 "After the collapse of the Nafan Empire, swathes of Estal suddenly lacked central authority. The result of this was local nobility taking over to a certain extent, setting up farms where indentured servants would work for them. This was the advent of serfdom, but a comprehensively feudal society had not yet emerged."
 desc_enlightenment:0 "In the power vacuum of the world after the Age of Titans, many military innovations were made by competing states in order to gain an advantage over others. One such was the invention of the first modern standing armies. Some of the first states to recruit professional soldiers were the kingdoms of Episol and Nheomyr, who both gained dominance over their respective neighborhoods. Standing armies tended to be better equipped and trained than their temporary counterparts."
 desc_industrialization:0 "The advancement of naval technology in the 6th century allowed for explorers to venture farther than ever before. In Estal, the Epilany set sail westward and discovered the island of Gacil. The Geopyopians, under the Qyva Dynasty, discovered the island of Elem off the coast of Makan."
 desc_feudalism_two:0 "The 7th century began with the destruction of almost every major power in and surrounding Estal. Ranpixa was crushed by Episol, who in turn together with Gorfrek, Nheomyr and Bhilis was crushed by the awakened Kaoad Horde. This caused central power in Estal to collapse, with local nobility taking over most governmental functions. Most of Estal degenerated into collections of city states, with the major exceptions of Apilanya and Emastaly maintaining some semblance of royal authority. This was the birth of feudalism, a system which would soon spread to much of the rest of Famana and shape its future for centuries to come."
