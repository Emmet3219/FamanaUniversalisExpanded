 LOADING_TIP_46:0 "I physically cannot watch Famana: Every Year anymore. I was there at the premiere of the video, and watched every small development that occurred. However, on my second rewatching of the video, I really couldn't stand Urbaxa's borders. I tried to rationalise them away somehow (unsuccessfully) but then I saw Toltas and lost my shit. Urbaxa was already highly stretching what was possible of a state, with its huge unadministratable borders and varieties of cultures and climates that would be unlikely to interact, even less obediently pay taxes with the capital. But Toltas shattered it for me. A nation state that went from Saka, which was known to be jungle at this point, which are extremely unadministratable, but also filled with millions of tribes and cultures. It also went across the fucking great desert, followed up by Ekelo and then across to all of fucking Ga Xal. It makes no sense to have a nation this big and absurd. Every time I try to watch Famana: Every Year, I physically foam at the mouth at seeing Urbaxa's terrible borders then I proceed to collapse into a straight seizure as soon as I see the letter 'T' on the map. I now live in physical pain and PTSD every time I see a Famana: Every Year screenshot. Reddit, help"
