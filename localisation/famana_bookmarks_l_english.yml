 FAMANA_REC_BOOKMARK: "§GRecommended Nations§W"
 FAMANA_REC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "In 212, most of Famana is in a precarious situation. The Gomic Sea, the traditional heart of civilized society, is decaying rapidly following the disastrous Yomtanian Wars against the Empire of Moxon. New empires such as Ordica and Fashros are on the rise to threaten the weak and fragmented region. In the south, the Empire of Dorromas is currently at its peak, and is meddling in the isolationist House of Tomba. Geopyopia has isolated themselves, and Hasmal is technologically stuck. Throughout the world, many tribes are scattered, some of which will grow into great empires.\n\n§YThese nations all have mission trees. Highlighted are the mod's best campaigns with the longest missions and most content.§!"

 FAMANA_TOMBA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Following the fall of the Kingdom of Hantomba, and the establishment of Liblatomba as its new successor to hold the Tombasorship, the House has been in disarray. With foreign influence in the once isolationist state growing, and dangerous new ideas spreading, keeping the House united will be a significant challenge for the coming years.\n\n§RThis region is not currently available.

 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK: "Fall of Moxon"
 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Once the world's greatest power, the Empire of Moxon was very shortlived. Its Yomtanian Armies ravaged the Gomic, but then mutinied after the discovery of a temple. This Temple, northeast of Maky, informed them of the existence of a second continent filled with more of their kind. In an attempt to kill the Yomtanians, the King of Maky set the temple alight, causing them to go berserk and obliterate the region, turning it into a series of post-apocalyptic states. As the traditional core of the region in Oppia, Jasua and Ga Xal decays, new powers such as Ordica and Fashros are on the rise. The story of the region is still very dynamic and volatile."

 FAMANA_GEOPYOPIA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "In 212, the largest and most powerful nation is the Empire of Geopyopia, formed after a warlord united the region following a succession crisis which destroyed the first dynasty. However, the Geopyopians are passive and traditional, and will have to compete with the Fashrans. The establishment of the Fashran Tonxara by the Tonmo tribes in order to spread the true religion is driving the state towards war and slavery, and the young empire is seeking West for its next conquests.\n\n§RGeopyopia is not fully supported and playing it is not recommended.§!"

 FAMANA_ESTAL_BOOKMARK: "Estali Wilderness"
 FAMANA_ESTAL_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Considered to be a new Frontier for expansion, West Estal is still currently mostly inhabited by tribes. These formed under the Yomtanian Empire of Hasia, which invaded and significantly depopulated the region. Tribes have now moved in to inhabit the region. The most powerful of these were the Nahallians, remnants of Ordican settlers, as well as their rival, now reduced to the minor nation of Alo Tramo. Additionally, the pagan Ordican religion has been banished to the wilderness by a growing Lathvy presence. The region will need to defend itself from invasions on all sides, from Ordica, Restema, Walara, Oppia - and maybe even a renewed Yomtanian menace."

 FAMANA_NARAVAM_BOOKMARK: "Northern Lights"
 FAMANA_NARAVAM_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Consisting of dry tundras and cold steppes, the northern regions of Estal are sparsely populated except for three civilisations. One is Naravam, located along the Western Coast. Currently, this society is mostly nomadic and focused on various bloody wars, but has the oppurtunity to grow into a great power in the future. The strongest nation, Rdumkatvar, has been made into a subject of Ordica. Gotzlica is located around a series of lakes, where the climate is temperate compared to the steppes south of them, inhabited by nomadic horsemen. However, the Gotzlicans should also be wary of a sleeping menace up even further north..."

 string_start_tag_gomic:0 "The Gomic is a very diverse place in 212. The region has just come out of the disastrous Yomtanian Wars which took down the Empire of Moxon, a nation which used Yomtanian armies to attempt to conquer the Gomic.\n\nIn the South-West, the Oppians used to be the largest empire in the world. The Oppian Empire went from Laglon to Quanex, Elorak, Makykay, Kinvirel, Degladon and Jimalkin. In 212 however, many years have passed since the collapse of the overextended empire. Oppia itself is centered around the port city of Quanex, controlled by the Crown Kingdom. This is a state which claims to be the successor to the ancient empire, and has the Crown of Emintas, used to crown Oppian Emperors, as proof. Despite this, Quanex is a decaying city as other cities in better positions such as Umzat, Elorak, Nuti, Nejavil and Astom are growing rapidly. In particular, Ossor is the most powerful Oppian nation. This is a desert empire with a militaristic culture which can pose a threat to the old core in the fertile West. Additionally, during the years of the Oppian Empire, many settlers were exiled out east to now form the East Oppian culture, one confused as to their identity ever since the collapse of the empire, and stuck between the Jasuans and Xalians.\n\nMaky is the most destroyed nation in 212. The Empire of Maky was obliterated by the Yomtanian wars following an incident at the Kashroon Temple. It was always the traditional core of civilisation, but it has now been devastated into anarchic tribes. As the survivors try to rebuild, the region may be threatened by new religions, and external invasions.\n\nGa Xal is the richest region in the world in 212. It is split primarily between the four powers of Noka Mor, Ale Mea, Moshiria and Delkia. The Xalian religion has been fragmented for a long time now, with the four religions each choosing a different patron God out of their pantheon. This is with the exception of Morian, which believes in one God. Although Moria used to dominate Ga Xal, ever since the formation of the Neo-Xalnish Empire after Sixan's conquest of Xon, the Morians have been oppressed. In 212, the Neo-Xalnish Empire has however fractured due to the damage of the Yomtanian Wars, and its future is still up in the air.\n\nMoxon was formerly founded by Xalian settlers, however it has developed a different identity. It has always been a naval region, focusing on trade and diplomacy. The Maxans set out and colonised many areas, such as Stroktur and Emastalia. However, following the collapse of the Maxan Empire, the islands have found themselves divided and confused. The remnants of the Empire's Jingoistic ideology has remained as the Maxan school of Lathvy Thought. Emastalia is also slowly developing an independent culture as they expand north, while Stroktur struggles to keep its native Kachik population docile.\n\nJasua is arguably in the most precarious position in 212. Split between the three powers of Kapolia, Yabonia and Kinvirel, the region still grasps onto pagan beliefs even as Lathvy is expanding. The ancient Jasuan Empire shattered at the hands of the Oppian Empire, which built up much of the infrastructure of the region. Now, along with the Aresian civilisation in the north, and various other cultures around the Aresian gulf, the region is trying to build a new identity. They will however need to be wary of a hazy threat that is coming from the east...\n\nPextoglazia is the dominant power of the Gomic in 212. Their decisive victory in the Great Gomic War and the Yomtanian Wars have left them as the most prestigous nation. However, not all is as it seems in the nation. The region still remembers the disastrous Hasian occupation, when the Yomtanian horde awoke from its slumber to conquer Estal. This eventually led to the Lathvy religion, which dominates the Gomic, being founded. The Pextoglazian school is based around the High Priest of Pomlen, a position established by the Lathvy Prophet himself. The issue is that this religious influence has to share power with the Holy King in a complicated government system. Western Pextoglazia has been divided up into Dioceses controlled by the High Priest which have autonomy over the King, and the King himself is chosen by the High Priest. Tensions may reach a boiling point and tear the nation apart should they cross the line.\n\nFinally, Ordica is a rising empire in 212. It is a fairly new nation, and has dedicated itself to depaganising its part of the continent. This is worrying as Ordica comes into tension with their southern former ally of Pextoglazia, and as Ordica looks north and west for expansion."

 string_start_tag_fashros:0 "The Fashran Tonxara is a young nation, having only formed a few decades ago. Its expansion was halted in year 206 after the disastrous Fashran-Geopyopian War, which forced it to sign a peace treaty with Geopyopia. This lead to the abdication of the prior Crota'tam Yharinel and the succession of Astrazna, a young ruler emboldened by the many pretenders he defeated to claim the throne. Since then he has consolidated his control of the Ravsho tribes, and, under his rule, several new cites like Pizuk and Tyma have sprung up. However, his greatest plans are yet to unfold. He has sent scouting parties into the vast western grasslands to explore beyond the borders of Fashros. His eagerness for conquest and glory is boundless, but the Fashran Horde has hit a hard barrier in Geopyopia. Therefore, Fashros must venture past the western horizon and into the great unknown."

 string_start_tag_oppia:0 "Oppia is a wealthy region in 212, with a reasonable degree of stability. The Oppian people rapidly assimilated many cultures during their rise as a great power, causing their region to be very ethnically homogenous, with the traces of previous cultures not being particularly visible. The Oppian Empire in question was founded by nations in the region corresponding to the modern Crown Kingdom, and spread out from there. At its height, the Oppians extended far beyond their current region - across southern Ga Xal and into Jasua. The issue, however, was overreliance on the loyalty of local governors, which often bogged the state down into putting down rebellions, and spelled its end when the Jasuan warlords revolted during the Great Gomic War, and the combined power of a Gomic coalition dismantled the decaying empire.\n\nIn the following years, the greatest remnant state of the ancient empire - the Quanex Realm - was established, but itself was plagued by political disaster. On the other hand, the Darlate of Sar sought out the Crown of Emintas, which was used to crown the old emperors. After the crown was found in Arlenta, Mensel Sar, the current leader of the Crown Kingdom, used his political skills to gain the crown for himself. The Kingdom of Arlenta itself fell apart shortly afterwards. During the Yomtanian Wars, Oppia was particularly badly hit, with the Quanex Realm dissolving and Sar taking over, estabilishing the Crown Kingdom, a self-proclaimed successor state to Oppia.\n\nAs of 212, the Reformed Oppian Heresy is spreading across Southern Oppia. Additionally, the traditional core of Oppian civilisation, the Quanex Peninsula, is also losing power as the Bay of Quanex is increasingly eroded and overpopulation causes people to emigrate. Ossor, a kingdom found deeper in the desert, is on the rise, while Umzatia is exploring the west."

 string_start_tag_xalian:0 "Ga Xal was the largest empire of its ancient time. Considered in many ways the first empire, it crossed from the tranquil Xon Strait, across the fertile Sixanian plains and into the Makyna Delta. They believed in four equal gods, champions of the four elements of the natural world. This didn't last long, as weaknesses in their dynasty of philosopher-kings caused civil wars. Many of these were caused by religious quarrels, as many religious groups began to debate on the status of the gods and their relationships with each other. When the empire collapsed, the main successors were four kingdoms, representing the four heresies, each prioritising a different element. These nations quickly broke apart due to instability, and there were mass migrations as people travelled from their lands to wherever they would be accepted. During this period, the Kingdom of Moria began to grow rapidly in power, declaring monotheism and almost conquering Ga Xal, before a series of disastrous wars with Oppia caused the fall of the nation. In following years, the further economic decline of some regions allowed for the rise of Sixan, a city state which went on to conquer Xon and form the Neo-Xalnish Empire.\n\nAt its peak, the Neo-Xalnish Empire was the only nation thus far to fully control all of Ga Xal. It was unfortunately also the main target of the Yomtanian Wars, and a series of factors such as a succession crisis and revolt of governors caused the rapid and shocking collapse of the empire practically overnight. As the Yomtanian Wars fade into history, the survivors must now pick up the pieces.\n\nMaky, on the other hand, is considered the oldest civilisation in the entire Gomic. During the Makyan Golden Age, they were the dominant power in the region, but during an event known as the Makyna Collapse, most other civilisations such as Bava, Zakon and Kars collapsed and disappeared from the historical record. Only Maky and Vaximor are left.\n\nApart from the Xalians, the Maxans are another group in the region. Formed from colonists coming from the mainland, their culture has diverged significantly. At its height, Moxon was a sprawling trade empire with colonies across the Gomic. It also accepted Lathvy as a religion, unlike the Xalians. The fall of Moxon came with the Yomtanian Wars, when the King was able to recruit and secretly bring over Yomtanians from Estal, which he used to try and conquer his region. This failed as the Yomtanians fled to Maky in an unforeseen horde behaviour, and crowded an ancient temple revealing the existence of Makan. When the Forces of Maky set the temple alight in an attempt to kill them, they flew into a mad rage and all of Maky was razed and destroyed.\n\nIn the current day, most of Ga Xal is united in spirit. The Vinians and Shirians see each other as brothers, and the religious differences are negligable. On the other hand, many are mistrustful of the Delkians, seen as extremists to their ethnoreligion and having cooperated with the Oppians and Maxans. The Morians have no state left, and the extinction of their religion is looming near. Meanwhile, as Moxon slips into irrelevancy, their former colonies in Emastalia and Stroktur are on the rise. Only time will tell what the four-power balance of Ga Xal will bring."

 string_start_tag_emast:0 "Emastalia is a newly settled region in 212. Formed from Maxan colonies, these have long been libertarian havens dominated by merchants. While seen as a backwater for much of their history, they have since broken free with the help of Pextoglazia. They are still mixed on religion, and seek to expand North into the wilderness.\n\nStroktur is another former Maxan colony. The region was initially inhabited by the Kalargan people, who were forced out by settlers, with their remants being the Kachik in the less developed North. Their people successfully revolted against Moxon in the past, forming the state of Bohora, a de facto Oppian puppet. Following the retreat of Oppia from Jasua, Moxon occupied the coast and annexed the South of the country, which was more amicable to returning to its \"owner\". The North continued to be independent under the nation of Stroktur, which was majority Kachik in culture but ruled almost entirely by an upper class of Bohorans. During the fall of Moxon, the unhappy nobles inside Maxan Bohora decided to defect to Stroktur, reuniting the country. However, with its huge Kachik population as well as reconcilliation between the two halves, the future is still uncertain..."

 string_start_tag_jasuan:0 "Jasua, despite its dry climate, was for a long time an economic powerhouse. The Bay of Kinvirel was responsible for handling enormous amounts of trade, and served as the gateway for Ga Xal and Moxon to access goods from the region. It was around this trade money that Jasua grew into an empire. This ended when Oppia invaded Jasua and the Oppian Emperor also declared himself Emperor of Jasua. Under Oppian rule, sea trade was shut off due to the risk of Maxan privateers, and instead expensive land caravans were used, causing economic decay in the region. Following the collapse of Oppia, the region was divided into the Lathvy Kingdom of Kapolia, the mountain country of Ghaloya, the endless and religiously diverse desert plains of Yabonia and Kinvirel, which became a republic.\n\nIn the North, the Aresians were a tribe that thought many wars with Oppia. They collapsed too into a series of minors, with the largest remnant being Nakoa, holding the two prestigious cities of Ayli and Arrol. Apart from that, around the Gulf are found many ancient cultures such as the Bamali and Biliks, now falling into decline. While their populations used to be significantly larger, a plague known as the Red Silence as well as poor treatement by the Yabonians has left them much worse off.\n\nAs the region continues to fight among itself however, it will need to be wary of a threat from the East...."

 string_start_tag_pexto:0 "The Pextoglazians are the descendants of settlers from Ga Xal as well as the local population, who have mixed together. The natives to Pextoglazia were tribes, resembling the Maldiks found further North. The region was home to many trade colonies formed by primarily Morian and Pawani settlers, who went on to adopt an aggressive attitude regarding these natives. Many were driven out, or were forcefully integrated into their societies, some as slaves. When the mainland fell to Neo-Xalnish conquest, the monarchs of these nations fled overseas to their colonies, and built proper nations there.\n\nThis changed with the Yomtanain Invasions. Pextoglazia was devastated by the occupation, losing huge swaths of its population. During this occupation however, a prophet called Romal Anohar founded the first Lathvy denominations. Although he was killed, his followers, supported by foreign efforts to drive out the Hasians, pushed back the Yomtanian horde. In the following years, the area was Lathvised, and the nations united under one nation - Pextoglazia. The High Priest of Pomlen was created, intended to be the leader of the Lathvy religion, and Pextoglazia expanded West.\n\nAlthough it is the strongest nation in the Gomic by many regard, it is still chaotic. For one, the nation is in a constant power wrestle between the High Priest and the King, both of whom want total control over the nation. The High Priest is chosen by the King, and the High Priest helps elect each King. Additionally, the scale of Pextoglazia means that many provinces are governed by Bishops who are loyal to Pextoglazia in name only. If these issues cannot be resolved, Pextoglazia's collapse might be immanent."

 string_start_tag_miris:0 "Miris is a tribal region, mostly unaware of the other civilisations around the Gomic. The Region remembers the disastrous Hasian occupation, and still tells many stories about it. They will also need to be wary of Foreigners from the South and the East who will come to colonise their land."

 string_start_tag_ordic:0 "In many respects, Ordica is the strongest nation as of 212. While not as wealthy or well developed as Pextoglazia, it so far has no major issues. Ordica does rely mostly on the cooperation of tribal chiefs and nobles, which could spell disaster in the future, but as of now it is stable.\n\nThe Ordics are a group which are ethnically and linguistically connected to the Maldiks as well as Pre-Pextoglazians. They have traditionally followed the Ordic religion, although this ended when they were invaded by Hasia. During this period, many people fled into Ordica's dense, impentrable forests. Following its liberation, Ordica converted to Lathvy, and the pagan Ordic religion has been dying out ever since. They have also forced Rdumkatvar, the first Naravami nation to unite into a kingdom, to swear loyalty to them.\n\nIn the West, Nahallia was another nation which converted to Lathvy following its liberation. The region used to have a huge population and a flourishing civilisation, but was almost entirely wiped out by the Yomtanians. The Nahallians have since claimed most of it, with the only opposition being Tolo, reduced into the rump state of Alo Tramo. Vamanya, on the other hand, has been flourishing, as well as a Yomtanian tribe which stayed behind following the retreat of the Hasians."

 string_start_tag_naravam:0 "Naravam is not a particularly developed region in 212. The Rduma people were able to unite into a state and threatened the Maldiks, but they suffered a humiliating loss to the Ordics and were forced to swear loyalty to them. The Rduma resent this, and will seek to gain back their honour however they can. Meanwhile, most of the rest of Naravam is currently tribal, with people groups moving and constantly hunting animals for food as well as religious reasons. Their pagan Torviya religion demands animal sacrifice to please the Spirits, and keep away the Ice Giants from breaching the Naravami Mountains."

 string_start_tag_vanoma:0 "Vanoma was responsible for a sigificant amount of technological innovation during its Golden Era. The first siege engines, basic algebra and the first universities were all pioneered in Vanoma. The civilisation lies on a floodplain surrounded by drylands and steppes, and so has been very united. Although they occasionally fight raiders from the steppe, they mostly have tended to historically keep to their own, in isolationism. As the Vanoman Golden Age comes to an end, Vanoma has opened up to the outside world, estabilishing the colony of Emtik and contacting nations such as Ordica or the Maxans. However, if a new threat presents itself, Vanoma could easily hide back into isolationism."

The situation has however changed, and now Hozy is split in two as Zubara creeps in to claim their place.\n\nLukscham, on the other hand, is a tribal and forested area, and is of little relevance in 212, but could play an important role in the future..."

Despite this, their percieved strength is merely a cover for their internal issues. Geopyopia is mostly concentrated around the fertile Hills and Floodplains of the North-East, as well as the Washoom Mountain, the Holiest site in the Washoom religion and the percieved source of Energy. The rest of Geopyopia is very dry or mountainous, and Warlords rule much of that region on behalf of the Geopyopian Emperor.\n\nIn 212, times are good and they are all loyal, however this has not been the case in the past. When the likely-mythical founder of Geopyopia, Haromaiam Gastoor, disappeared, the First Dynasty quickly fell apart. The Current Dynasty prays that they can keep stability, and their recent triumph over the Fashran Tonxara has been percieved positively, even as they doom many Washoom believers in the North. In addition, apart from internal issues or the rise of Fashros, the Geopyopians might need to worry about hidden threats lurking just offshore..."

Even in the current era, their technology has been unreproducible, and their Empire stretched from Han to Avus, across the Qartura Steppe and Qamoni Mountains. However, at a certain point, all records from the Empire just... disappear. From what Historians understand, it was split into two halves - two paranoid, xenophobic \"houses\", being Tomba and Qamon. Where Tomba, from recent Dorroman reports, seems to have kept this government form, Qamon quickly collapsed due to internal pressure and Barbarian invasions.\n\nDorromas claims to be the descendants of such invaders, who came in from the Steppe. Although ethnically they are the same as the other Qamonis, they pride themselves extensively on this percieved steppe heritage. Under the rule of Narbyoz the Great, they were able to reunite the shattered fragments of the old House of Avusqamon.\n\nDuring their conqeust of Qanoyo, in the South of the region, the King and many of his nobles fled on Horseback to the East. When they reached the territory of the old Imperial provinces of Zrut, Catvila and Klondor, they were shocked to find shallowly dug graves and burnt out ruins of the great Imperial Capital. While there were some basic tribes there, they had no recollection of Agmagoz and believed the ruins to be some sort of Holy Site. The exiles proceeded to still establish their state, still believing that they were the rightful successors to a title hundreds of miles away, and trying to force the locals to adopt their cultural customs.\n\nBoth Dorromas and Qanoyo have interfered in the isolationist House of Tomba, often supporting opposite sides."

Where Qamon, from what foreign Diplomats have told us, seems to have kept this government form, Tomba has managed to preserve it.\n\nThe Tombans are ruled by a Tombasor, who is a special type of Monarch. They are always crowned in the same City, although the specific city has changed over the years - from Polt to Han to now Libla. The local cities inside the House each have an immense amount of autonomy, and frequently wage war against each other, free of the Emperor's grip. The domestication of the Bite Giant, huge lumbering land mammals used for War, has made these far more destructive, and allowed Han to control the house for a long period of time.\n\nIn the past, the House was particularly plagued with the issue of Kras, which started as a city state confederation but then swelled to become more powerful than every other state combined, and was only forcefully dismantled via political intrigue and military support from Qanoyo. This plot was discovevered, and an alliance of Tomban states waged war to remove the Tombasor, and changed the location of the new Tombasor to Libla, where the title currently resides. With foreign powers meddling, and disunity seeping in, the House will need to be wary of new threats that will inevitably come."

The Omosha religion believes in the Death of the three creator Gods, who fell to Earth and made the world. In particular, the city of Mansheva enforces religious orthodoxy, and will try to crush any heresy, as well as keeping internal peace. Apart from Mansheva, authority is also drawn from Velorad, who functions as the \"Emperor\" of Vishma. This is a title elected from the Vishman kings on the death of the previous Velorad. In addition to taxes, each nation must provide a special good straight to the Velorad's palace. In 212, the current Velorad is Shovela.\n\nThe Avzazi are a seafaring people, who gain most of their economy from fishing. The Avzazi culture also dissallows land war, and so battles are mostly waged on the Water.\n\nFinally, Ad'ovi is series of Forested tribes found in the south.
